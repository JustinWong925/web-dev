# nodetest2
Nodetest2 is a tutorial following this: http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2014/restful-web-app-node-express-mongodb/
With help on how to GET, POST and DELETE information from a mongodb database.
This is a single webpage based form, it does not require other views, just simply updating one page.
This is completed using Jade, NodeJS, MongoDB, and AJAX.

Good practice would be to work on UPDATE
necessary to modify /views/index.jade, /routes/users.js, /app.js and /public/javascripts/global.js
